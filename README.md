# Dark Forest

This project simulates the Dark Forest model of the Universe as described in the well-known Sci-Fi [The Three-Body-Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem)

### Background
Go READ the book.
```{go}
if TL;DR { 
	intro1 := "civilizations are like citizens of the dark forest, \\
	and they are hidden from each other. Some of them naively think that all civilizations would be friendly to each other"

	intro2 := "some high-level civilizations already learnt the dark forest model of the universe \\
	so they chose to remain quiet and hideen. But for those who didn't, they either lit up a fire or shouted \\
	greetings hoping to hear back from their 'brothers'"

	intro3 := "however, because of barrier of communication (or chain of suspicion) and technology \\ 
	explosion (this part is something you should definitely read in the book), those who heard the  \\
	voices or saw the fire only had one choice but to destroy the rule breaker in order to keep its own safety"

	return Dark_Forest_Simulator
}
```
